# Web Crawler

### Web Crawler is my first Go project. It counts the internal links on a website of your choice.

## How to use:

Fork the project and ensure you have Go installed.
`cd`into the project
run the command `go build .`
To use the program you can then run `./crawler "https://example.com" 3 10`
Choose the website you would like to crawl in quotes, followed by the max concurrency you would like to use and the max number of pages

Run the report and you should see something like this:
